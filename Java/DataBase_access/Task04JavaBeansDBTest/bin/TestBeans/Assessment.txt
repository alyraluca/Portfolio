1. We opted to have 6 classes to manage the operations and a main class to run our program.
In the DBBean class we manage our connections to the database and our methods that helped us to
modify and get information from out database. We have a source class called PlayerBean that have 
new setters and getters that get to knock at the door of the listener(s) by calling firePropertyChange with a
tag name and an old and new value (mainly the matches and deferral status and dates). Then we have
the MessageBean that handles the messages that get inserted in the tables depending on the property that gets triggered
in the main programme.The GameBean and DeferralBean classes also handle  database updates depending on the property event fired.
Finally, our TestPlayer (main programme) is in charge of assigning the object source to the listeners 
and triggering the property change events by assigning new values to different properties.

2. My main difficulty was connecting to the database I kept getting null pointers. Then I had problems
setting the object source and listeners in the main programme. It wouldn't trigger the listeners and it wouldn't make the
appropriated changes and it would only show the messages. Also at first, I would trigger the database changes
and updates from the main programme instead of the listeners and I think that's why I had that problem. I also had
problems with the deferral id and I had to generated randomly.

3.We could improve the activity by randomly deciding the result of a game (Pending, won, lost, draws) or
the ability to see the players game history, wins and losses.
